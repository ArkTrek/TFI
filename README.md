# The Fake Incrementer - TFI

Welcome to TFI - The Fun Incrementer, a fun and interactive project that simulates fake earnings growth in real-time! Whether you want to pretend you're earning big or just enjoy watching numbers rise, this app is designed to give you that dopamine hit of successâ€”without the actual cash! ðŸ¤‘

## Features
- Dynamic Earnings: Watch your fake total earnings, reward earnings, and completed tasks increase smoothly.
- Payout Simulation: Payout values increase in sync with your earnings. Fake wealth, fake payouts! ðŸ’µ
- Smooth Transitions: All updates happen with satisfying smooth transitions to make it feel like you're growing rich.

## How It Works ?
The app simulates earnings and payouts in real-time with automatic updates every few seconds. The following values are incremented:
- Total Earnings
- Reward Earnings
- Tasks Completed
- Payout Amount
All values increase smoothly with small random increments, simulating the look and feel of a real payment dashboard.

- Payouts: Automatically synced with total earnings to provide realistic payout values.
Just sit back and watch your imaginary bank account fill up!

## Customization
### Adjust Increment Speed:
   Want to increase or decrease how fast your fake earnings grow? Modify the setInterval function in the JavaScript code:
   ```
        setInterval(updateEarnings, 2000);  // Updates every 2 seconds
   ```
    
   ---
    
   ### Change Increment Amounts
   To earn faster, you can modify the random increment values for earnings:
   ```
        let newTotalEarnings = totalEarnings + (Math.random() * 1);
        let newRewardEarnings = rewardEarnings + (Math.random() * 0.2);
   ```

   ### Replace the PayPal Logo
   If you prefer another payment provider logo (or your own fictional one), just replace the PayPal image URL:
   ```
            <img src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/webstatic/mktg/logo/pp_cc_mark_111x69.jpg" alt="PayPal" class="paypal-logo">
   ```
